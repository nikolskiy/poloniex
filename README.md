# Poloniex
Poloniex python API wrapper for aerials. There is already awesome [Poloniex python API client for humans](https://github.com/Aula13/poloniex).
What if aerials need a python Poloniex wrapper as well? ;)

## Description
I'm not associated with Poloniex by any means. Everything is based on their [API description](https://poloniex.com/support/api/)
and inspired by other similar projects from Github.

## Status
Work in progress
